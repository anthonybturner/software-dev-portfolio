        Full-Stack Software Developer with 10+ years of experience architecting and delivering high-performance, maintainable applications. 
        Proficient in .NET Core/8, ASP.NET (MVC/Web API/Web Forms), Angular (JS–v1–v19, Angular Material), TypeScript, JavaScript, 
        Python/Django, and relational databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL). Strong expertise in asynchronous programming, 
        concurrency patterns, scalable API design, DTO/entity mapping, database transactions, caching strategies, and modern deployment 
        workflows using Git, CI/CD, Docker, Vercel, Render, Railway, and Azure.

          Passionate advocate for <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and clean architecture. I prioritize object encapsulation, dependency 
          injection, and separation of concerns to create extensible, testable codebases that scale with business needs. Every solution I 
          deliver emphasizes code clarity, maintainability, and long-term sustainability—recognizing that the true cost of software lies 
          in its evolution, not its creation.

          This portfolio exemplifies these principles: built entirely by me using Angular 19 for a component-driven SPA architecture, TypeScript 
          for type safety, and SCSS for modular styling. I applied SOLID patterns throughout—extracting components by responsibility, using 
          services for data management, configuring behavior through dependency injection, and organizing shared models in a models folder 
          for reusability. The application demonstrates advanced Angular routing, RxJS reactive patterns, Angular Signals for fine-grained 
          reactivity, computed properties for derived state management, API integration, accessibility best practices, and automated CI/CD 
          deployment on Vercel—all while maintaining clean, refactorable code.
