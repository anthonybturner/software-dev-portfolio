    Building scalable, maintainable solutions with SOLID principles
  </p>

  <p>

    <strong>
      Passionate advocate for <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and clean architecture. I prioritize object
      encapsulation, dependency
      injection, and separation of concerns to create extensible, testable codebases that scale with business needs.
      Every solution I
      deliver emphasizes code clarity, maintainability, and long-term sustainability—recognizing that the true cost of
      software lies
      in its evolution, not its creation.
    </strong>

    <strong>
      This portfolio exemplifies these principles: built entirely by me using Angular 19 for a component-driven SPA
      architecture, TypeScript
      for type safety, and SCSS for modular styling. I applied SOLID patterns throughout—extracting components by
      responsibility, using
      services for data management, configuring behavior through dependency injection, and organizing shared models in a
      models folder
      for reusability. The application demonstrates advanced Angular routing, RxJS reactive patterns, Angular Signals
      for fine-grained
      reactivity, computed properties for derived state management, API integration, accessibility best practices, and
      automated CI/CD
      deployment on Vercel—all while maintaining clean, refactorable code.
