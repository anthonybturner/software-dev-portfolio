        <span>Anthony B Turner</span>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Full-Stack Software Developer with 10+ years of experience delivering high-performance applications. Skilled in
        .NET Core/8, ASP.NET (MVC/Web API/Web Forms), Angular (JS–v1–v19, Angular Material), TypeScript, JavaScript,
        Python/Django, and relational databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL). Experienced in asynchronous
        programming, concurrency, scalable API design, DTO/entity mapping, database transactions, caching strategies,
        and
        modern deployment workflows using Git, CI/CD, Docker, Vercel, Render, Railway, and Azure. Known for delivering
        secure, maintainable solutions in Agile/Scrum teams.
        <br><br>
        <strong>
          This portfolio web application was built entirely by me, leveraging Angular 20 for a robust SPA architecture,
          TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, and SCSS for modular, scalable styling. I utilized modern CSS
          custom properties for dynamic theming and responsive design, and implemented a component-driven structure for
          reusability and performance. The application integrates automated CI/CD workflows and is deployed using Vercel
          for seamless updates and global scalability. Key skills applied include advanced Angular routing, RxJS for
          reactive programming, API integration, accessibility best practices, and cloud deployment strategies.
          Throughout development, I paid close attention to typography and the organization of custom properties for
          maintainable, consistent design.
